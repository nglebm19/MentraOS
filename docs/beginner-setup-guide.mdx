## What is MentraOS?

MentraOS is an open-source operating system and development platform for smart glasses. Think of it as "Android for smart glasses" - it provides:

- **Cross-compatibility**: Your apps work on any supported smart glasses
- **Easy development**: Use familiar web technologies (TypeScript, React)
- **Real-time communication**: Apps can respond to voice, gestures, and sensors
- **Cloud integration**: Powerful backend services for AI, storage, and more

### Why Smart Glasses?

Smart glasses are the next evolution of personal computing:
- **Hands-free interaction**: Perfect for when your hands are busy
- **Always-available information**: Get help without looking at your phone
- **Augmented reality**: Overlay digital information on the real world
- **Accessibility**: Help people with disabilities access technology

## Understanding the Architecture

Before diving in, let's understand how MentraOS works:

## Step 1: Install Development Tools

### 1.1 Install Node.js

**Why**: MentraOS apps are built with TypeScript/JavaScript

**Windows:**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the LTS version (18.x or later)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install node

# Or download from nodejs.org
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Using NodeSource repository
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

### 1.2 Install Bun (Recommended)

**Why**: Bun is faster than npm and is the preferred package manager for MentraOS

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Restart your terminal, then verify
bun --version
```

### 1.3 Install Git

**Why**: Required for cloning repositories and version control

**Windows:**
- Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- Run installer with default settings

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install git

# Or install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### 1.4 Install a Code Editor

**Recommended: Visual Studio Code**

1. Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Install these extensions:
   - TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
   - Prettier - Code formatter
   - ESLint
   - GitLens

## Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

### 2.1 Create a Development Directory

```bash
# Create a dedicated folder for MentraOS development
mkdir mentraos-development
cd mentraos-development
```

### 2.2 Clone the MentraOS Repository

```bash
# Clone the main repository
git clone https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS.git
cd MentraOS

# Verify the structure
ls -la
```

You should see folders like:
- `mobile/` - Mobile app source code
- `cloud/` - Backend services
- `asg_client/` - Smart glasses client
- `docs/` - Documentation

### 2.3 Set Up Mobile App Development

**For Android Development:**

1. **Install Android Studio:**

   - Install with default settings
   - Open Android Studio and complete the setup wizard

2. **Install Android SDK:**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to Tools â†’ SDK Manager
   - Install Android 13 (API 33) or later
   - Install Android SDK Build-Tools

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   
   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   # Add to System Environment Variables
   ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   # Add to PATH
   %ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
   %ANDROID_HOME%\tools
   ```

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
   ```

**For iOS Development (macOS only):**

   - Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```

2. **Install CocoaPods:**
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```

### 2.4 Set Up Cloud Development

```bash
# Navigate to cloud directory
cd cloud

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

**Note**: For external contributors, you'll need to set up accounts with various services. See the [Local Development Setup](local-setup) guide for detailed instructions.

## Step 3: Get Smart Glasses (Optional)

### Supported Smart Glasses

| Device | Type | Display | Camera | Price Range | Best For |
|--------|------|---------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Mentra Live** | Android-based | No | Yes | $200-400 | Camera apps, streaming |
| **Even Realities G1** | HUD | Yes | No | $800-1200 | Display apps, AR |

| **Vuzix Z100** | HUD | Yes | No | $1000+ | Enterprise apps |

### Choosing Your First Glasses

**For beginners, we recommend:**

1. **Mentra Live** - Best for learning camera-based development
2. **Even Realities G1** - Best for learning display-based development

**If you don't have glasses yet:**
- You can still develop and test apps using the mobile app
- Use the simulator mode for basic testing
- Consider borrowing or renting glasses for initial development

### Setting Up Your Glasses

**For Mentra Live:**
1. Charge the glasses fully
2. Download MentraOS mobile app
3. Follow the in-app pairing instructions
4. Connect to WiFi through the app

**For HUD glasses:**
1. Charge the glasses
2. Download MentraOS mobile app
3. Pair via Bluetooth
4. Calibrate the display if prompted

## Step 4: Create Your First App

### 4.1 Choose a Starting Template

We'll use the Live Captions example - it's perfect for beginners:

```bash
# Create a new app from template
gh repo create my-first-mentraos-app --template Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Cloud-Example-App

# Clone your new repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-first-mentraos-app.git
cd my-first-mentraos-app

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### 4.2 Set Up Your App

1. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the .env file:**
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   PACKAGE_NAME=com.yourname.myfirstapp
   MENTRAOS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Register your app:**
   - Go to [console.mentra.glass](https://console.mentra.glass)
   - Sign in with your account
   - Click "Create App"
   - Use the package name from your .env file
   - Copy the API key to your .env file

### 4.3 Run Your App

```bash
# Start the development server
bun run dev

# In another terminal, expose your app to the internet
ngrok http 3000
```

### 4.4 Test Your App

1. **Install MentraOS mobile app** on your phone
2. **Pair your glasses** (if you have them)
3. **Open the MentraOS app** and look for your app
4. **Launch your app** and test the functionality

## Step 5: Test Your Setup

### 5.1 Verify Mobile App Development

```bash
# Navigate to mobile directory
cd ../mobile

# Install dependencies
npm install

# For iOS (macOS only)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Start the development server
npm start

# In another terminal, run on device
npm run android  # or npm run ios
```

### 5.2 Verify Cloud Development

```bash
# Navigate to cloud directory
cd ../cloud

# Start development environment
bun run dev

# Check if services are running
curl http://localhost:8002/health
```

### 5.3 Test App Integration

1. **Create a simple test app** that displays "Hello World"
2. **Deploy it locally** using ngrok
3. **Register it** in the developer console
4. **Test it** on your mobile app and glasses
